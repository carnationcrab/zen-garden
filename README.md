### What is this for?

For general mechanics practice, and c++ learning. When I figure out the (a?) legitimate purpose of this project, I'll give more of a description here. For now, this is a place for me to do some maths/physics/algorithms/c++ discovery without having to really have an outcome in mind.

### Who is losschicken and why did they make a bunch of commits?

Whoops. I was attempting to create a new github and instead just messed up my git logins across my system. Ignore that, losschicken and I are one and the same.
